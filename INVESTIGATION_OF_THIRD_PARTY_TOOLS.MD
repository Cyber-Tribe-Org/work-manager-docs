## Jira

Users can create Projects. Project templates are available at the moment of creation.

Jira supports Kanban and Scrum.

Project templates can be created.

People can be involved in projects.

Projects have issues which can be different types - Task, Story, Epic, Feature, etc... They can be pre-generated or uniquely created per project.

Issues have properties which can be manually assigned to issues, depending on the needs. Those properties can contain multipurpose information.
